we consider the STOCHASTIC MULTI-ARMED BANDIT PROBLEM with a PRIOR DISTRIBUTION on the REWARD DISTRIBUTIONS . we are interested in studying PRIOR-FREE AND PRIOR-DEPENDENT REGRET BOUNDS , very much in the same spirit than the usual DISTRIBUTION-FREE AND DISTRIBUTION-DEPENDENT BOUNDS for the NON-BAYESIAN STOCHASTIC BANDIT . we first show that THOMPSON SAMPLING attains an optimal <unk> bound in the sense that for any PRIOR DISTRIBUTION its BAYESIAN REGRET is bounded from above by 14  <unk> . this result is <unk> in the sense that there exists a PRIOR DISTRIBUTION such that any algorithm has a BAYESIAN REGRET bounded from below by 1 20  <unk> . we also study the case of THOMPSON SAMPLING for the setting of <unk> et al. -lsb- 2013 -rsb- -lrb- where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the smallest gap -rrb- and we show that in this case the regret of THOMPSON SAMPLING is in fact uniformly bounded over time , thus showing that THOMPSON SAMPLING can greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these THOMPSON SAMPLING .

this paper describes ongoing research on a JAPANESE-TO-ENGLISH SPEECH-TO-SPEECH TRANSLATION SYSTEM for '' controlled <unk> '' , such as TV NEWS and COMMENTARY PROGRAMS in which the SPEAKING STYLES are controlled as a <unk> . we have adopted the DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH since the tv programs in question cover a wide range of topics , and because it seems much too labor intensive to <unk> TRANSLATION RULES . the DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH therefore requires a <unk> PARALLEL CORPUS for the target domain , although the ABSOLUTE SIZE needed is not so easy to obtain . there are also difficulties inherent in <unk> such as the need to handle long sentences , averaging over 25 words , and the REALIZATION OF SIMULTANEITY . these problems are presented in the light of our available corpora and we go on to present the kinds of problems we have to solve . finally , we present our prospective system architecture and introduce the present status of the work .

efficient two-step algorithms are described for optimizing the STOPBAND RESPONSE of the PROTOTYPE FILTER for COSINE-MODULATED AND MODIFIED DFT FILTER BANKS either in the MINIMAX or in the least-mean-square sense subject to the maximum allowable ALIASING AND AMPLITUDE ERRORS . the first step involves finding a good START-UP SOLUTION using a simple technique . this START-UP SOLUTION is improved in the second step by using NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION . several examples are included illustrating the flexibility of the proposed START-UP SOLUTION for making compromises between the required FILTER LENGTHS and the ALIASING AND AMPLITUDE ERRORS . these examples show that by allowing very small amplitude and ALIASING ERRORS , the stopband performance of the resulting PROTOTYPE FILTER is significantly improved compared to the corresponding PERFECT-RECONSTRUCTION FILTER BANK . alternatively , the FILTER ORDERS and , consequently , the overall delay can be significantly reduced to achieve practically the same performance .

this paper considers an AUTOMATIC VOICE RESPONSE APPLICATION in which a WORD UTTERANCE is inserted into a fixed carrier sentence . an important task here is to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR of the INSERTED WORD according to the F 0 CONTEXT of the carrier sentence . instead of generating the F 0 CONTOUR on syllable basis , we employ an approach to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR of the whole word . in this approach , two questions arise : -lrb- a -rrb- how to evaluate the F 0 CONTEXT and -lrb- b -rrb- how to adjust the F 0 CONTOUR suitably for the context . we have found that the F 0 CONTOUR of a word can be appropriately regulated in a <unk> word-level f 0 range -lrb- <unk> 0 r -rrb- . after estimating the WF 0 RS of the preceding and succeeding words , the <unk> 0 r of the INSERTED WORD is set at the mean of these WF 0 RS . the F 0 CONTOUR of the INSERTED WORD is then mapped to the <unk> 0 r taking into account the TONE COMBINATION of the word . a perceptual evaluation experiment showed that the adjusted f 0 was coordinated well with the context .

this paper discusses the application of the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM to the task of CHINESE VERB SENSE DISCRIMINATION . the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM utilized RICH LINGUISTIC FEATURES that capture PREDICATE-ARGUMENT STRUCTURE INFORMATION of the target verbs . a SEMANTIC TAXONOMY for CHINESE NOUNS , which was built semi-automatically based on two ELECTRONIC CHINESE SEMANTIC DICTIONARIES , was used to provide SEMANTIC FEATURES for the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM . purity and NORMALIZED MUTUAL INFORMATION were used to evaluate the clustering performance on 12 CHINESE VERBS . the experimental results show that the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM can learn sense or sense group distinctions for most of the verbs successfully . we further enhanced the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM with certain FINE-GRAINED SEMANTIC CATEGORIES called LEXICAL SETS . our results indicate that these LEXICAL SETS improve the EXPECTATION-MAXIMIZATION CLUSTERING ALGORITHM 's performance for the three most challenging verbs chosen from the first set of experiments .

several early GAME-PLAYING COMPUTER PROGRAMS used FORWARD PRUNING -lrb- i.e. , the practice of deliberately ignoring nodes that are believed unlikely to affect a GAME TREE 's minimax value -rrb- , but this technique did not seem to result in good decision-making . the poor performance of FORWARD PRUNING presents a major puzzle for ai research on GAME PLAYING , because some version of FORWARD PRUNING seems to be '' what people do , '' and the best CHESS-PLAYING PROGRAMS still do not play as well as the best humans . as a step toward deeper understanding of FORWARD PRUNING , we have set up models of FORWARD PRUNING on two different kinds of GAME TREES , and used these models to investigate how FORWARD PRUNING affects the probability of choosing the correct move . in our studies , FORWARD PRUNING did better than <unk> when there was a high correlation among the MINIMAX VALUES OF SIBLING NODES in a GAME TREE . this result suggests that FORWARD PRUNING may possibly be a useful DECISION-MAKING TECHNIQUE in certain kinds of games . in particular , we believe that bridge may be such a game .

the MAP -lrb- maximum a POSTERIORI HYPOTHESIS -RRB- PROBLEM in BAYESIAN NETWORKS is to find the most likely states of a set of variables given partial evidence on the complement of that set . standard STRUCTURE-BASED INFERENCE METHODS for finding exact solutions to MAP , such as VARIABLE ELIMINATION and JOIN-TREE ALGORITHMS , have complexities that are exponential in the CONSTRAINED TREEWIDTH OF THE NETWORK . a more recent algorithm , proposed by <unk> and <unk> , is exponential only in the TREEWIDTH and has been shown to handle networks whose CONSTRAINED TREEWIDTH is quite high . in this paper we present a new algorithm for exact MAP that is not necessarily limited in scalability even by the TREEWIDTH . this is achieved by leverag-ing recent advances in COMPILATION OF BAYESIAN NETWORKS into ARITHMETIC CIRCUITS , which can circumvent TREEWIDTH-IMPOSED LIMITS by exploiting the LOCAL STRUCTURE present in the BAYESIAN NETWORKS . specifically , we implement a BRANCH-AND-BOUND SEARCH where the BOUNDS are computed using LINEAR-TIME OPERATIONS on the COMPILED ARITHMETIC CIRCUIT . on networks with LOCAL STRUCTURE , we observe orders-of-magnitude improvements over the algorithm of <unk> and <unk> . in particular , we are able to efficiently solve many problems where the latter algorithm runs out of memory because of high TREEWIDTH .

sparse signal approximation can be used to design efficient LOW BIT-RATE CODING SCHEMES . SPARSE SIGNAL APPROXIMATION heavily relies on the ability to design appropriate dictionaries and corresponding DECOMPOSITION ALGORITHMS . the size of the dictionary , and therefore its resolution , is a key parameter that handles the tradeoff between SPARSITY and tractability . this work proposes the use of a non adaptive random sequence of <unk> in a GREEDY DECOMPOSITION PROCESS , thus browsing a larger DICTIONARY SPACE in a PROBABILISTIC FASHION with no additional projection cost nor PARAMETER ESTIMATION . this SPARSE SIGNAL APPROXIMATION leads to very SPARSE DECOMPOSITIONS , at a CONTROLLED COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY . experimental evaluation is provided as proof of concept for LOW BIT RATE COMPRESSION OF AUDIO SIGNALS .

the goal of SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION is to identify the emotional or physical state of a human being from his or her voice . one of the most important things in a SPEECH EMOTION RECOGNITION is to extract and select relevant SPEECH FEATURES with which most emotions could be recognized . in this paper , we present a SMOOTHED NONLINEAR ENERGY OPERATOR - based amplitude modulation cepstral coefficients -lrb- <unk> -rrb- feature for RECOGNIZING EMOTIONS from SPEECH SIGNALS . SMOOTHED NONLINEAR ENERGY OPERATOR estimates the energy required to produce the AM-FM SIGNAL , and then the estimated energy is separated into its AMPLITUDE AND FREQUENCY COMPONENTS using an ENERGY SEPARATION ALGORITHM . AMCC FEATURES are obtained by first decomposing a SPEECH SIGNAL using a C-CHANNEL GAMMATONE FILTERBANK , computing the AM POWER SPECTRUM , and taking a DISCRETE COSINE TRANSFORM of the ROOT COMPRESSED AM POWER SPECTRUM . conventional MFCC -lrb- mel-frequency cepstral coefficients -rrb- and <unk> dft -lrb- discrete fourier transform -rrb- spectrum based cepstral coefficients -lrb- <unk> -rrb- FEATURES are used for comparing the RECOGNITION performances of the proposed FEATURES . EMOTION RECOGNITION experiments are conducted on the FAU AIBO SPONTANEOUS EMOTION CORPUS . it is observed from the experimental results that the AMCC FEATURES provide a relative improvement of approximately 3.5 % over the baseline MFCC .

spectral EMBEDDING based on the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is a widely used '' preprocessing '' step in many LEARNING TASKS , typically leading to DI-MENSIONALITY REDUCTION by projecting onto a number of DOMINANT SINGULAR VECTORS and <unk> the COORDINATE AXES -lrb- by a PREDEFINED FUNCTION of the singular value -rrb- . however , the number of such vectors required to capture PROBLEM STRUCTURE grows with PROBLEM SIZE , and even PARTIAL SVD COMPUTATION becomes a bottleneck . in this paper , we propose a LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , which employs RANDOM PROJECTIONS and FINITE ORDER POLYNOMIAL EXPANSIONS to compute approximations to SVD-BASED EMBEDDING . for an M  N MATRIX with T NON-ZEROS , its TIME COMPLEXITY is o -lrb- -lrb- t + m + n -rrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , and the EMBEDDING DIMENSION is o -lrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , both of which are independent of the number of SINGULAR VECTORS whose effect we wish to capture . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of SINGULAR VECTORS for GENERAL SVD-BASED EMBEDDINGS . the key to <unk> the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is the observation that , for DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS such as CLUSTERING and classification , we are only interested in using the resulting EMBEDDING to evaluate PAIRWISE SIMILARITY METRICS derived from the  2-norm , rather than capturing the effect of the underlying MATRIX on ARBITRARY VECTORS as a partial SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION tries to do . our numerical results on NETWORK DATASETS demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , and motivate further exploration of its application to DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS .

the classical way of ENCODING PREFERENCES in DECISION THEORY is by means of UTILITY OR VALUE FUNCTIONS . however agents are not always able to deliver such a function directly . in this paper , we relate three different ways of specifying preferences , namely by means of a set of particular types of CONSTRAINTS on the UTILITY FUNCTION , by means of an ordered set of PRIORITIZED GOALS expressed by LOGICAL PROPOSITIONS , and by means of an ordered set of subsets of possible candidates reaching the same level of satisfaction . these different EXPRESSION MODES can be handled in a WEIGHTED LOGICAL SETTING , here the one of POSSIBILISTIC LOGIC . the AGGREGATION OF PREFERENCES pertaining to different criteria can then be handled by fusing sets of PRIORITIZED GOALS . apart from a better EXPRESSIVITY , the benefits of a LOGICAL REPRESENTATION OF PREFERENCES are to put them in a suitable format for REASONING PURPOSES , or for modifying or revising them .

the COMPACT DESCRIPTION OF A VIDEO SEQUENCE through a single IMAGE MAP and a DOMINANT MOTION has applications in several domains , including VIDEO BROWSING AND RETRIEVAL , COMPRESSION , MOSAICING , and VISUAL SUMMARIZATION . building such a COMPACT DESCRIPTION OF A VIDEO SEQUENCE requires the capability to register all the frames with respect to the dominant object in the scene , a task which has been , in the past , addressed through TEMPORALLY LOCALIZED MOTION ESTIMATES . in this paper , we show how the lack of TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY associated with such estimates can <unk> the validity of the DOMINANT MOTION ASSUMPTION , leading to <unk> between different scene interpretations and poor registration . to avoid this <unk> , we augment the MOTION MODEL with a GENERIC TEMPORAL CONSTRAINT which increases the ROBUSTNESS against competing interpretations , leading to more meaningful CONTENT SUMMARIZATION .

statistical approaches for building NON-RIGID DEFORMABLE MODELS , such as the ACTIVE APPEARANCE MODEL , have enjoyed great popularity in recent years , but typically require tedious MANUAL ANNOTATION OF TRAINING IMAGES . in this paper , a LEARNING BASED APPROACH for the AUTOMATIC ANNOTATION OF VISUALLY DEFORMABLE OBJECTS from a single ANNOTATED FRONTAL IMAGE is presented and demonstrated on the example of AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATING FACE IMAGES that can be used for building ACTIVE APPEARANCE MODEL for FITTING and TRACKING . this LEARNING BASED APPROACH employs the idea of initially learning the CORRESPONDENCES BETWEEN LANDMARKS in a FRONTAL IMAGE and a set of training images with a face in arbitrary poses . using this learner , VIRTUAL IMAGES OF UNSEEN FACES at any ARBITRARY POSE for which the learner was trained can be reconstructed by predicting the new LANDMARK LOCATIONS and warping the TEXTURE from the FRONTAL IMAGE . VIEW-BASED AAMS are then built from the VIRTUAL IMAGES and used for automatically annotating UNSEEN IMAGES , including images of different facial expressions , at any random pose within the MAXIMUM RANGE spanned by the virtually RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES . the LEARNING BASED APPROACH is experimentally validated by AUTOMATICALLY ANNOTATING FACE IMAGES from three different databases .

we present a method for REGION IDENTIFICATION in multiple images . a set of regions in different images and the correspondences on their boundaries can be thought of as a boundary in the MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPACE formed by the product of the individual image domains . we minimize an ENERGY FUNCTIONAL on the space of such boundaries , thereby identifying simultaneously both the optimal regions in each image and the optimal correspondences on their boundaries . we use a RATIO FORM for the ENERGY FUNCTIONAL , thus enabling the GLOBAL MINIMIZATION OF THE ENERGY FUNCTIONAL using a POLYNOMIAL TIME GRAPH ALGORITHM , among other desirable properties . we choose a simple form for this energy that <unk> boundaries that lie on HIGH INTENSITY GRADIENTS in each image , while encouraging correspondences between boundaries in different images that match INTENSITY VALUES . the latter tendency is weighted by a novel HEURISTIC ENERGY that encourages the boundaries to lie on disparity or OPTICAL FLOW DISCONTINUITIES , although no DENSE OPTICAL FLOW or DISPARITY MAP is computed .

assessing similarity between FEATURES is a key step in OBJECT RECOGNITION and SCENE CATEGORIZATION TASKS . we argue that knowledge on the DISTRIBUTION OF DISTANCES generated by SIMILARITY FUNCTIONS is crucial in deciding whether FEATURES are similar or not . intuitively one would expect that similarities between FEATURES could arise from any DISTRIBUTION . in this paper , we will derive the contrary , and report the theoretical result that L P-NORMS -- a class of commonly applied distance metrics -- from one FEATURE VECTOR to other vectors are <unk> if the FEATURE VALUES are correlated and <unk> distributed . besides these assumptions being realistic for IMAGES , we experimentally show them to hold for various popular FEATURE EXTRACTION ALGORITHMS , for a diverse range of IMAGES . this fundamental insight opens new directions in the assessment of FEATURE SIMILARITY , with projected improvements in OBJECT AND SCENE RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS .

a recent trend in SALIENCY ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT is LARGE-SCALE BENCHMARKING and ALGORITHM RANKING with ground truth provided by DATASETS OF HUMAN FIXATIONS . in order to accommodate the strong BIAS humans have toward CENTRAL FIXATIONS , SHUFFLED ROC METRIC is common to replace traditional ROC METRICS with a SHUFFLED ROC METRIC which uses RANDOMLY SAMPLED FIXATIONS from other images in the database as the negative set . however , the <unk> roc introduces a number of problematic elements , including a fundamental assumption that SHUFFLED ROC METRIC is possible to separate VISUAL SALIENCE and image spatial arrangement . we argue that SHUFFLED ROC METRIC is more informative to directly measure the effect of SPATIAL BIAS on algorithm performance rather than try to correct for SHUFFLED ROC METRIC . to capture and quantify these known sources of BIAS , we propose a novel metric for measuring SALIENCY ALGORITHM performance : the spatially <unk> roc -lrb- <unk> -rrb- . this metric provides direct insight into the SPATIAL BIASES of a SALIENCY ALGORITHM without sacrificing the intuitive raw performance evaluation of traditional ROC METRICS . by quantitatively measuring the BIAS in SALIENCY ALGORITHMS , researchers will be better equipped to select and optimize the most appropriate algorithm for a given task . we use a baseline measure of inherent algorithm BIAS to show that ADAPTIVE WHITENING SALIENCY -lsb- 14 -rsb- , attention by INFORMATION MAXIMIZA-TION -lsb- 8 -rsb- , and DYNAMIC VISUAL ATTENTION -lsb- 20 -rsb- provide the least spatially biased results , <unk> them for tasks in which there is no information about the underlying SPATIAL BIAS of the stimuli , whereas algorithms such as GRAPH BASED VISUAL SALIENCY -lsb- 18 -rsb- and CONTEXT-AWARE SALIENCY -lsb- 15 -rsb- have a significant inherent central BIAS .

multi-task learning attempts to simultaneously leverage data from multiple domains in order to estimate related functions on each domain . for example , a special case of MULTI-TASK LEARNING , TRANSFER LEARNING , is often employed when one has a good estimate of a function on a SOURCE DOMAIN , but is unable to estimate a related function well on a target domain using only target data . MULTI-TASK/TRANSFER LEARNING PROBLEMS are usually solved by imposing some kind of '' smooth '' relationship <unk> tasks . in this paper , we study how different SMOOTHNESS ASSUMPTIONS on TASK RELATIONS affect the upper bounds of algorithms proposed for these MULTI-TASK/TRANSFER LEARNING PROBLEMS under different settings . for general MULTI-TASK LEARNING , we study a family of algorithms which utilize a REWEIGHTING MATRIX on task weights to capture the smooth relationship among tasks , which has many instantiations in existing literature . furthermore , for MULTI-TASK LEARNING in a TRANSFER LEARNING FRAMEWORK , we study the recently proposed algorithms for the '' model shift '' , where the conditional distribution p -lrb- y | x -rrb- is allowed to change across tasks but the change is assumed to be smooth . in addition , we illustrate our results with experiments on both SIMULATED AND REAL DATA .

previous RESOLUTION-BASED APPROACHES to THEORY-GUIDED INDUCTION OF LOGIC PROGRAMS produce hypotheses in the form of a set of <unk> of a theory , where the RESOLVENTS represent allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS for the initial theory . there are , however , many characterizations of allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS that can not be expressed by a set of RESOLVENTS . one approach to this THEORY-GUIDED INDUCTION OF LOGIC PROGRAMS is presented , the system <unk> , which is based on an earlier technique for learning NITE-STATE AUTOMATA that represent allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS . <unk> extends the previous technique in three ways : i -rrb- negative examples are considered in addition to positive examples , ii -rrb- a new strategy for performing GENERALIZATION is used , and iii -rrb- a technique for converting the learned automaton to a LOGIC PROGRAM is included . results from experiments are presented in which <unk> outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing GENERALIZATION , and a traditional COVERING TECHNIQUE . the latter result can be explained by the limited expressiveness of hypotheses produced by covering and also by the fact that covering needs to produce the correct BASE CLAUSES for a RECURSIVE DENITION before producing the RECURSIVE CLAUSES . <unk> on the other hand does not require that particular examples of the base cases are given , since both BASE CLAUSES and RECURSIVE CLAUSES can be inferred from a single example .

decision making under uncertainty is commonly modelled as a process of COMPETITIVE STOCHASTIC EVIDENCE ACCUMULATION to threshold -lrb- the DRIFT-DIFFUSION MODEL -rrb- . however , it is unknown how animals learn these DECISION THRESHOLDS . we examine THRESHOLD LEARNING by constructing a REWARD FUNCTION that averages over many trials to WALD 'S COST FUNCTION that defines DECISION OPTIMALITY . these REWARD FUNCTION are highly stochastic and hence challenging to optimize , which we address in two ways : first , a simple TWO-FACTOR REWARD-MODULATED LEARNING RULE derived from WILLIAMS ' REINFORCE METHOD for NEURAL NETWORKS ; and second , BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION of the REWARD FUNCTION with a GAUSSIAN PROCESS . BAYESIAN OPTIMIZATION converges in fewer trials than REINFORCE but is slower computationally with greater variance . the WILLIAMS ' REINFORCE METHOD is also a better model of ACQUISITION BEHAVIOUR in animals and a similar LEARNING RULE has been proposed for MODELLING BASAL GANGLIA FUNCTION .

we consider the problem of LEARNING CONTROL POLICIES via TRAJECTORY PREFERENCE QUERIES to an expert . in particular , the LEARNING CONTROL POLICIES presents an expert with short runs of a pair of POLICIES originating from the same state and the expert indicates which trajectory is preferred . the LEARNING CONTROL POLICIES 's goal is to elicit a LATENT TARGET POLICY from the expert with as few queries as possible . to tackle this problem we propose a novel BAYESIAN MODEL of the QUERYING PROCESS and introduce two methods that exploit this BAYESIAN MODEL to actively select expert queries . experimental results on four benchmark problems indicate that our BAYESIAN MODEL can effectively learn POLICIES from TRAJECTORY PREFERENCE QUERIES and that ACTIVE QUERY SELECTION can be substantially more efficient than RANDOM SELECTION .

most methods for DECISION-THEORETIC ONLINE LEARNING are based on the HEDGE ALGORITHM , which takes a PARAMETER called the LEARNING RATE . in most previous analyses the LEARNING RATE was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance , leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances , for example when there exists an action that is significantly better than all others . we propose a new way of setting the LEARNING RATE , which adapts to the difficulty of the DECISION-THEORETIC ONLINE LEARNING : in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance , but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret . in particular , our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a PROBABILISTIC SETTING , when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions . we also provide a SIMULATION STUDY comparing our approach to existing methods .

this paper presents a new approach for estimating voice source and vocal tract filter characteristics of VOICED SPEECH . when it is required to know the TRANSFER FUNCTION of a system in SIGNAL PROCESSING , the input and output of the system are experimentally observed and used to calculate the function . however , in the case of SOURCE-FILTER SEPARATION we deal with in this paper , only the output -lrb- speech -rrb- is observed and the characteristics of the system -lrb- vocal tract -rrb- and the input -lrb- voice source -rrb- must simultaneously be estimated . hence the estimate becomes extremely difficult , and it is usually solved approximately using OVERSIMPLIFIED MODELS . we demonstrate that these characteristics are separable under the assumption that they are independently controlled by different factors . the separation is realised using an ITERATIVE APPROXIMATION along with the MULTI-FRAME ANALYSIS METHOD , which we have proposed to find spectral envelopes of VOICED SPEECH with minimum interference of the HARMONIC STRUCTURE .

we propose two approaches for improving the OBJECTIVE FUNCTION for the DEEP NEURAL NETWORK FRAME-LEVEL TRAINING in LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION . the LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION used in LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION are often constructed with an OUTPUT LAYER with SOFTMAX ACTIVATION and the CROSS-ENTROPY OBJECTIVE FUNCTION is always employed in the <unk> training of LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION . the pairing of SOFTMAX ACTIVATION and CROSS-ENTROPY OBJECTIVE FUNCTION contributes much in the success of LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION . the first approach developed in this paper improves the CROSS-ENTROPY OBJECTIVE FUNCTION by boosting the importance of the frames for which the LARGE VOCABULARY CONTINUOUS SPEECH RECOGNITION has low target predictions -lrb- low target posterior probabilities -rrb- and the second one considers jointly minimizing the <unk> and maximizing the LOG POSTERIOR RATIO between the target <unk> -lrb- <unk> states -rrb- and the most competing one . experiments on SWITCHBOARD TASK demonstrate that the two proposed methods can provide 3.1 % and 1.5 % RELATIVE WORD ERROR RATE REDUCTION , respectively , against the already very strong conventional CROSS-ENTROPY TRAINED DNN SYSTEM .

causal structure learning from TIME SERIES DATA is a major scientific challenge . EXTANT ALGORITHMS assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly ; more precisely , they assume approximately equal system and measurement timescales . in many domains , however , measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes , but the size of the TIMESCALE MISMATCH is often unknown . this paper develops three CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS , each of which discovers all DYNAMIC CAUSAL GRAPHS that explain the OBSERVED MEASUREMENT DATA , perhaps given UNDERSAMPLING . that is , these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS all learn CAUSAL STRUCTURE in a `` <unk> '' manner : they do not assume any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales . we apply these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS to data from simulations to gain insight into the challenge of UNDERSAMPLING .

in GAME-PLAYING PROGRAMS relying on the MINIMAX PRINCIPLE , DEEPER SEARCHES generally produce better evaluations . theoretical analyses , however , suggest that in many cases <unk> amplifies the NOISE introduced by the HEURISTIC FUNCTION used to evaluate the leaves of the GAME TREE , leading to what is known as PATHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR , where DEEPER SEARCHES produce worse evaluations . in most of the previous research , positions were evaluated as losses or wins . dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic GAME TREES that eliminates the PATHOLOGY and explains why MINIMAX is successful in practice . in this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on VALUE DEPENDENCE . we show that if real numbers are used for POSITION VALUES , POSITION VALUES tend to be further apart at lower levels of the GAME TREE , which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions , where error is less probable . decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the PATHOLOGY and no additional properties of GAME TREES are required .

this paper presents a CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION for training ADAPTIVE FILTERS using the MAXIMUM CORRENTROPY CRITERION . CORRENTROPY has been recently proposed as a robust similarity measure between two RANDOM VARIABLES or signals , when the PDF S involved are heavy <unk> and NON-GAUSSIAN . maximizing the CROSS-CORRENTROPY between the output of an ADAPTIVE FILTERS and the desired response leads to the MAXIMUM CORRENTROPY CRITERION for ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS TRAINING . we show that a CLOSED FORM , CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION of the FILTER WEIGHTS using this CLOSED FORM yields a simple WEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES like formulation . our simulations show that training the FILTER WEIGHTS using this CLOSED FORM RECURSIVE SOLUTION is much faster than GRADIENT BASED TRAINING , and more accurate than the RLS ALGORITHM in cases where the ERROR PDF is NON-GAUSSIAN and heavy <unk> .

we resolve a <unk> old open question in VISIBILITY-BASED PURSUIT EVASION : how many pursuers are needed to capture an evader in an ARBITRARY POLYGONAL ENVIRONMENT with obstacles ? the evader is assumed to be adversarial , moves with the same MAXIMUM SPEED as pursuers , and is '' sensed '' by a <unk> only when it lies in <unk> of that <unk> . the players move in DISCRETE TIME STEPS , and the capture occurs when a <unk> reaches the position of the evader on its move . our main result is that o -lrb-  h + log n -rrb- pursuers can always win the game with a DETERMINISTIC SEARCH STRATEGY in any <unk> with n vertices and h obstacles -lrb- holes -rrb- . in order to achieve this bound , however , we argue that the environment must satisfy a MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE PROPERTY , which essentially requires the MINIMUM DISTANCE between any two vertices to be of the same order as the speed of the players . without the MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE ASSUMPTION , we show that  -lrb- n / log n -rrb- pursuers are needed in the worst-case even for SIMPLY-CONNECTED POLYGONS OF N VERTICES ! this reveals an unexpected <unk> that seems to have been overlooked in previous work <unk> that O -LRB- LOG N -RRB- PURSUERS can always win in SIMPLY-CONNECTED N-GONS . our lower bound also shows that capturing an evader is inherently more difficult than just '' seeing '' it because O -LRB- LOG N -RRB- PURSUERS are prov-ably sufficient for LINE-OF-SIGHT DETECTION even against an arbitrarily fast evader in simple <unk> .

sponsored search is an important MONETIZATION CHANNEL for SEARCH ENGINES , in which an AUCTION MECHANISM is used to select the ads shown to users and determine the prices charged from advertisers . there have been several pieces of work in the literature that investigate how to design an AUCTION MECHANISM in order to optimize the revenue of the SEARCH ENGINES . however , due to some unrealistic assumptions used , the practical values of these studies are not very clear . in this paper , we propose a novel GAME-THEORETIC MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH , which naturally combines MACHINE LEARNING and GAME THEORY , and learns the AUCTION MECHANISM using a BILEVEL OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK . in particular , we first learn a MARKOV MODEL from HISTORICAL DATA to describe how advertisers change their bids in response to an AUCTION MECHANISM , and then for any given AUCTION MECHANISM , we use the learnt MARKOV MODEL to predict its corresponding future bid sequences . next we learn the AUCTION MECHANISM through EMPIRICAL REVENUE MAXIMIZATION on the PREDICTED BID SEQUENCES . we show that the empirical revenue will converge when the PREDICTION PERIOD approaches infinity , and a GENETIC PROGRAMMING ALGORITHM can effectively optimize this empirical revenue . our experiments indicate that the proposed GAME-THEORETIC MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH is able to produce a much more effective AUCTION MECHANISM than several baselines .

we present in this paper a novel approach for training DETERMINISTIC AUTO-ENCODERS . we show that by adding a well chosen penalty term to the CLASSICAL RECONSTRUCTION COST FUNCTION , we can achieve results that equal or surpass those attained by other REGULARIZED AUTO-ENCODERS as well as DENOISING AUTO-ENCODERS on a range of datasets . this penalty term corresponds to the FROBENIUS NORM of the JACOBIAN MATRIX of the ENCODER ACTIVATIONS with respect to the input . we show that this penalty term results in a LOCALIZED SPACE CONTRACTION which in turn yields robust FEATURES on the ACTIVATION LAYER . furthermore , we show how this penalty term is related to both REGULARIZED AUTO-ENCODERS and DENOISING AUTO-ENCODERS and how it can be seen as a link between DETERMINISTIC AND NON-DETERMINISTIC AUTO-ENCODERS . we find empirically that this penalty helps to <unk> a representation that better captures the LOCAL DIRECTIONS OF VARIATION dictated by the data , corresponding to a LOWER-DIMENSIONAL NON-LINEAR MANIFOLD , while being more invariant to the vast majority of directions orthogonal to the MANIFOLD . finally , we show that by using the learned FEATURES to initialize a MLP , we achieve state of the art classification error on a range of datasets , surpassing other methods of PRE-TRAINING .

kernel functions have become an extremely popular tool in MACHINE LEARNING , with an attractive theory as well . this theory views a kernel as implicitly mapping data points into a possibly very high dimensional space , and describes a KERNEL FUNCTION as being good for a given LEARNING PROBLEM if data is separable by a large margin in that IMPLICIT SPACE . however , while quite elegant , this theory does not directly correspond to one 's intuition of a good kernel as a good SIMILARITY FUNCTION . furthermore , it may be difficult for a domain expert to use the theory to help design an appropriate kernel for the LEARNING PROBLEM at hand since the IMPLICIT MAPPING may not be easy to calculate . finally , the requirement of POSITIVE SEMI-DEFINITENESS may rule out the most NATURAL PAIRWISE SIMILARITY FUNCTIONS for the given problem <unk> this work we develop an alternative , more general theory of learning with SIMILARITY FUNCTIONS -lrb- i.e. , sufficient conditions for a SIMILARITY FUNCTION to allow one to learn well -rrb- that does not require reference to IMPLICIT SPACES , and does not require the function to be positive semi-definite -lrb- or even symmetric -rrb- . our results also generalize the standard theory in the sense that any good KERNEL FUNCTION under the usual definition can be shown to also be a good SIMILARITY FUNCTION under our definition -lrb- though with some loss in the parameters -rrb- . in this way , we provide the first steps towards a THEORY OF KERNELS that describes the effectiveness of a given KERNEL FUNCTION in terms of NATURAL SIMILARITY-BASED PROPERTIES .

this paper proposes a SEMI-SUPERVISED BOOSTING APPROACH to improve STATISTICAL WORD ALIGNMENT with LIMITED LABELED DATA and large amounts of UNLABELED DATA . the proposed SEMI-SUPERVISED BOOSTING APPROACH modifies the SUPERVISED BOOSTING ALGORITHM to a SEMI-SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHM by incorporating the UNLABELED DATA . in this SEMI-SUPERVISED BOOSTING APPROACH , we build a WORD ALIGNER by using both the LABELED DATA and the UNLABELED DATA . then we build a PSEUDO REFERENCE SET for the UNLABELED DATA , and calculate the ERROR RATE of each WORD ALIGNER using only the LABELED DATA . based on this SUPERVISED BOOSTING ALGORITHM , we investigate two BOOSTING METHODS for STATISTICAL WORD ALIGNMENT . in addition , we improve the STATISTICAL WORD ALIGNMENT results by combining the results of the two SEMI-SUPERVISED BOOSTING METHODS . experimental results on STATISTICAL WORD ALIGNMENT indicate that SEMI-SUPERVISED BOOSTING achieves RELATIVE ERROR REDUCTIONS of <unk> % and <unk> % as compared with SUPERVISED BOOSTING and UNSUPERVISED BOOSTING , respectively .

AUTOMATIC COL-ORIZATION is nontrivial since there is usually no ONE-TO-ONE CORRESPONDENCE between color and LOCAL TEXTURE . the contribution of our framework is that we deal directly with MULTIMODALITY AND ESTIMATE , for each PIXEL of the image to be colored , the PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION of all possible colors , instead of choosing the most probable color at the LOCAL LEVEL . we also predict the expected variation of color at each PIXEL , thus defining a NON-UNIFORM SPATIAL COHERENCY CRITERION . we then use GRAPH CUTS to maximize the probability of the whole COLORED IMAGE at the GLOBAL LEVEL . we work in the L-A-B COLOR SPACE in order to approximate the HUMAN PERCEPTION OF DISTANCES between colors , and we use MACHINE LEARNING TOOLS to extract as much information as possible from a DATASET OF COLORED EXAMPLES . the resulting algorithm is fast , designed to be more robust to TEXTURE NOISE , and is above all able to deal with ambiguity , in contrary to previous approaches .

bounded confidence opinion dynamic models have received much recent interest as models of INFORMATION PROPAGATION in SOCIAL NETWORKS and LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTED AVERAGING . however in the existing literature , opinions are only viewed as abstract quantities rather than as part of a DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM . in this work , OPINION DYNAMICS are examined when agents are BAYESIAN DECISION MAKERS that perform HYPOTHESIS TESTING or SIGNAL DETECTION . BOUNDED CONFIDENCE is defined on PRIOR PROBABILITIES of hypotheses through BAYES RISK ERROR DIVERGENCE , the appropriate measure between PRIORS in HYPOTHESIS TESTING . this definition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in the standard model : absolute error . it is shown that the rapid convergence of PRIOR PROBABILITIES to a small number of LIMITING VALUES is similar to that seen in the standard model . the most interesting finding in this work is that the number of these LIMITING VALUES changes with the SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO in the HYPOTHESIS TESTING TASK . the number of final values or CLUSTERS is maximal at INTERMEDIATE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS , suggesting that the most <unk> issues lead to the largest number of <unk> .

for INTERNET APPLICATIONS like SPONSORED SEARCH , <unk> need to be taken when using MACHINE LEARNING to optimize their mechanisms -lrb- e.g. , auction -rrb- since SELF-INTERESTED AGENTS in these applications may change their behaviors -lrb- and thus the DATA DISTRIBUTION -rrb- in response to the mechanisms . to tackle this problem , a framework called game-theoretic MACHINE LEARNING -lrb- <unk> -rrb- was recently proposed , which first learns a MARKOV BEHAVIOR MODEL to characterize agents behaviors , and then learns the optimal MARKOV BEHAVIOR MODEL by simulating agents ' behavior changes in response to the MARKOV BEHAVIOR MODEL . while <unk> has demonstrated practical success , its GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS is challenging because the BEHAVIOR DATA are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the MARKOV BEHAVIOR MODEL . to address this challenge , first , we decompose the GENERALIZATION ERROR for <unk> into the BEHAVIOR LEARNING ERROR and the BEHAVIOR LEARNING ERROR ; second , for the BEHAVIOR LEARNING ERROR , we obtain novel NON-ASYMPTOTIC ERROR BOUNDS for both PARAMETRIC AND NON-PARAMETRIC BEHAVIOR LEARNING METHODS ; third , for the BEHAVIOR LEARNING ERROR , we derive a UNIFORM CONVERGENCE bound based on a new concept called nested covering number of the MECHANISM SPACE and the GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES developed for mixing sequences .

this paper presents an AGENT-BASED MODEL that studies the emergence and evolution of a LANGUAGE SYSTEM of LOGICAL CONSTRUCTIONS , i.e. a vocabulary and a set of GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS that allows the expression of LOGICAL COMBINATIONS OF CATEGORIES . the AGENT-BASED MODEL assumes the agents have a common vocabulary for basic categories , the ability to construct LOGICAL COMBINATIONS OF CATEGORIES using BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS , and some general purpose cognitive capacities for INVENTION , ADOPTION , INDUCTION and ADAPTATION . but it does not assume the agents have a vocabulary for BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS nor GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS for expressing such LOGICAL COMBINATIONS OF CATEGORIES through language . the results of the experiments we have performed show that a LANGUAGE SYSTEM of LOGICAL CONSTRUCTIONS emerges as a result of a process of <unk> of the individual agents ' interactions when these agents adapt their preferences for vocabulary and GRAMMATICAL CONSTRUCTIONS to those they observe are used more often by the rest of the population , and that such a LANGUAGE SYSTEM is transmitted from one generation to the next .

a common assumption in MACHINE VISION is that the training and test samples are drawn from the same DISTRIBUTION . however , there are many problems when this assumption is <unk> violated , as in BIO-MEDICAL APPLICATIONS where different <unk> can generate drastic variations in the appearance of the data due to changing experimental conditions . this MACHINE VISION is <unk> with 3D DATA , for which ANNOTATION is very time-consuming , limiting the amount of data that can be labeled in new <unk> for training . in this paper we present a MULTI-TASK LEARNING ALGORITHM for DOMAIN ADAPTATION based on BOOSTING . unlike previous approaches that learn TASK-SPECIFIC DECISION BOUNDARIES , our MULTI-TASK LEARNING ALGORITHM learns a single DECISION BOUNDARY in a SHARED FEATURE SPACE , common to all tasks . we use the BOOSTING-TRICK to learn a NON-LINEAR MAPPING of the observations in each task , with no need for specific a-priori knowledge of its GLOBAL ANALYTICAL FORM . this yields a more PARAMETER-FREE DOMAIN ADAPTATION APPROACH that successfully leverages learning on new tasks where LABELED DATA is scarce . we evaluate our MULTI-TASK LEARNING ALGORITHM on two challenging BIO-MEDICAL DATASETS and achieve a significant improvement over the state of the art .

foreign accents in SECOND LANGUAGE PRODUCTION are caused by interference from the PHONOLOGICAL SYSTEM and phonetic realization of the speaker 's first language -lrb- l1 -rrb- , including both SEGMENTAL AND PROSODIC FEATURES . this paper examines the intonation structure of SEOUL KOREAN and its realization by AMERICAN ENGLISH SPEAKERS . four ENGLISH SPEAKERS OF KOREAN , differing in fluency , and two KOREAN SPEAKERS participated in the experiment . <unk> sentences were designed to test the realization of intonation patterns by varying the number of syllables within a word and a sentence , and by varying the conditions for the SEGMENT-TONE INTERACTION . results show that , as with SEGMENTAL DATA , more advanced L2 SPEAKERS produce more NATIVE-LIKE INTONATION PATTERNS and PROSODIC STRUCTURE than less advanced speakers . however , although advanced L2 SPEAKERS are better at grouping words into phrases , L2 SPEAKERS are not better at producing SURFACE TONAL REALIZATIONS of an accentual phrase than less advanced speakers . this suggests that PHONOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF INTONATION are acquired earlier than PHONETIC PROPERTIES OF INTONATION .

a reduced complexity realisation for the NORMALISED CONSTANT MOD-ULUS ALGORITHM and its SOFT CRITERION SATISFACTION VERSION is proposed based on SELECTIVE PARTIAL UPDATING . the COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY of NORMALISED CONSTANT MOD-ULUS ALGORITHM and SOFT CRITERION SATISFACTION VERSION is reduced by updating a BLOCK OF EQUALISER PARAMETERS at every iteration rather than the entire <unk> . this results in a smaller number of MULTIPLICATIONS for updating the EQUALISER PARAMETERS . a simple BLOCK SELECTION CRITERION is derived from the solution of a CONSTRAINED MINIMISATION PROBLEM that underpins the development of NORMALISED CONSTANT MOD-ULUS ALGORITHM . in FRACTIONALLY-SPACED EQUALISATION , the proposed SELECTIVE PARTIAL UPDATING is shown to be capable of maintaining comparable CONVERGENCE SPEED to its FULL-UPDATE COUNTERPART . this implies a significant reduction in IMPLEMENTATION COST without necessarily <unk> the CONVERGENCE SPEED .

the STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION PROBLEM has been extensively studied in the field of COMPUTER VISION . yet , the bulk of the existing work assumes that the scene contains only a single moving object . the more realistic case where an unknown number of objects move in the scene has received little attention , especially for its theoretical treatment . in this paper we present a new method for separating and recovering the motion and SHAPE of multiple independently moving objects in a sequence of images . the method does not require prior knowledge of the number of objects , nor is dependent on any grouping of FEATURES into an object at the IMAGE LEVEL . for this purpose , we introduce a MATHEMATICAL CONSTRUCT OF OBJECT SHAPES , called the SHAPE INTERACTION MATRIX , which is invariant to both the OBJECT MOTIONS and the SELECTION OF COORDINATE SYSTEMS . this SHAPE INTERACTION MATRIX is computable solely from the observed trajectories of IMAGE FEATURES without grouping them into individual objects . once the SHAPE INTERACTION MATRIX is computed , SHAPE INTERACTION MATRIX allows for SEGMENTING FEATURES into objects by the process of transforming SHAPE INTERACTION MATRIX into a CANONICAL FORM , as well as recovering the SHAPE and motion of each object .

frequency domain blind source separation -lrb- FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION -rrb- is shown to be equivalent to two sets of FREQUENCY DOMAIN ADAPTIVE MICROPHONE ARRAYS , i.e. , ADAPTIVE NULL BEAM-FORMERS . the minimization of the OFF-DIAGONAL COMPONENTS in the BSS UPDATE EQUATION can be viewed as the minimization of the MEAN SQUARE ERROR in the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION . the UNMIXING MATRIX of the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION and the FILTER COEFFICIENTS of the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION converge to the same solution in the MEAN SQUARE ERROR SENSE if the two source signals are ideally independent . therefore , we can conclude that the performance of the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION is upper bounded by that of the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION . this understanding clearly explains the poor performance of the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION in a real room with long reverberation . the fundamental difference exists in the adaptation period when they should adapt . that is , the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION can adapt in the presence of a JAMMER but the absence of a target , whereas the FREQUENCY DOMAIN BLIND SOURCE SEPARATION can adapt in the presence of a target and JAMMER , and also in the presence of only a target .

in many MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS , labeling every instance of data is <unk> . MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING , in which training data is provided in the form of labeled bags rather than labeled instances , is one approach for a more relaxed form of SUPERVISED LEARNING . though much progress has been made in analyzing MIL PROBLEMS , existing work considers bags that have a finite number of instances . in this paper we argue that in many applications of MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING -lrb- e.g. IMAGE , AUDIO , etc. -rrb- the bags are better modeled as LOW DIMENSIONAL MANIFOLDS in HIGH DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE . we show that the GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE of such MANIFOLD BAGS affects PAC-LEARNABILITY . we discuss how a learning algorithm that is designed for FINITE SIZED BAGS can be adapted to learn from MANI-FOLD BAGS . furthermore , we propose a simple HEURISTIC that reduces the MEMORY REQUIREMENTS of such algorithms . our experiments on REAL-WORLD DATA validate our analysis and show that our approach works well .

traditional MICROPHONE ARRAY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS simply recognise the enhanced output of the array . as the level of SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT depends on the number of microphones , such MICROPHONE ARRAY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS do not achieve acceptable SPEECH RECOGNITION performance for arrays having only a few microphones . for SMALL MICROPHONE ARRAYS , we instead propose using the enhanced output to estimate a RELIABILITY MASK , which is then used in MISSING DATA SPEECH RECOGNITION . in MISSING DATA SPEECH RECOGNITION , the DECODED SEQUENCE depends on the RELIABILITY MASK of each input feature . this RELIABILITY MASK is usually based on the signal to noise ratio in each frequency band . in this paper , we use the energy difference between the NOISY INPUT and the enhanced output of a small microphone array to determine the FREQUENCY BAND RELIABILITY . RECOGNITION experiments with a small array demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique , compared to both traditional MICROPHONE ARRAY ENHANCEMENT and a BASELINE MISSING DATA SYSTEM .

with improved RECOGNITION ACCURACIES for LVCSR TASKS , it has become possible to search large collections of SPONTANEOUS SPEECH for a variety of information . the MALACH CORPUS OF HOLOCAUST TESTIMONIALS is one such collection , in which we are interested in automatically transcribing and retrieving portions that are relevant to NAMED ENTITIES such as people , places , and organizations . since the <unk> were gathered from thousands of people in countries throughout europe , an extremely large number of potential NAMED ENTITIES are possible , and this causes a well-known dilemma : increasing the size of the vocabulary allows for more of these words to be recognized , but also increases confusability , and can harm RECOGNITION performance . however , the MALACH CORPUS OF HOLOCAUST TESTIMONIALS , like many other collections , includes SIDE INFORMATION or MALACH CORPUS OF HOLOCAUST TESTIMONIALS that can be exploited to provide prior information on exactly which NAMED ENTITIES are likely to appear . this paper proposes a method that capitalizes on this prior information to reduce NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION ERRORS by over 50 % relative , and simultaneously decrease the overall WORD ERROR RATE by 7 % relative . the MALACH CORPUS OF HOLOCAUST TESTIMONIALS we use derives from a PRE-INTERVIEW QUESTIONAIRE that includes the names of friends , <unk> , places visited , membership of organizations , synonyms of place names , and similar information . by augmenting the LEXICON AND LANGUAGE MODEL with this information on a SPEAKER-BY-SPEAKER BASIS , we are able to exploit the TEXTUAL INFORMATION that is already available in the corpus to facilitate much improved SPEECH RECOGNITION .

clustering is a basic task in a variety of MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS . partitioning a set of INPUT VECTORS into compact , WELL-SEPARATED SUBSETS can be severely affected by the presence of MODEL-INCOMPATIBLE INPUTS called OUTLIERS . the present paper develops robust clustering algorithms for jointly partitioning the data and identifying the OUTLIERS . the novel approach relies on translating SCARCITY OF OUTLIERS to SPARSITY in a JUDICIOUSLY DEFINED DOMAIN , to <unk> three widely used CLUSTERING SCHEMES : HARD K-MEANS , FUZZY K-MEANS , and PROBABILISTIC CLUSTERING . CLUSTER CENTERS and assignments are iteratively updated in CLOSED FORM . the developed OUTLIER-AWARE ALGORITHMS are guaranteed to converge , while their COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY is of the same order as their OUTLIER-AGNOSTIC COUNTERPARTS . preliminary simulations validate the analytical claims . 
GEN
in this paper , we propose a new method for machine learning applications . the proposed method is based on the idea of probabilistic clustering , which we call the judiciously defined domain . the proposed method is based on the judiciously defined domain and is based on the judiciously defined domain . it is shown that the computational complexity of the proposed method is very close to that of the conventional outlier-agnostic counterparts . it is shown that the proposed computational complexity can be applied to other clustering schemes such as clustering , fuzzy k-means , and probabilistic clustering . in addition , the proposed method is shown to be more efficient than other outlier-agnostic counterparts such as sparsity and sparsity .

in VISUAL RECOGNITION PROBLEMS , the common DATA DISTRIBUTION MISMATCHES between training and testing make DOMAIN ADAPTATION essential . however , IMAGE DATA is difficult to manually divide into the DISCRETE DOMAINS required by ADAPTATION ALGORITHMS , and the standard practice of <unk> datasets with domains is a weak proxy for all the real conditions that alter the statistics in complex ways -lrb- lighting , POSE , BACKGROUND , RESOLUTION , etc. -rrb- we propose an approach to automatically discover LATENT DOMAINS in IMAGE OR VIDEO DATASETS . our formulation imposes two key properties on domains : MAXIMUM DISTINCTIVENESS and MAXIMUM LEARNABILITY . by MAXIMUM DISTINCTIVENESS , we require the underlying distributions of the identified domains to be different from each other to the MAXIMUM EXTENT ; by MAXIMUM LEARNABILITY , we ensure that a strong DISCRIMINATIVE MODEL can be learned from the domain . we devise a NONPARAMETRIC FORMULATION and efficient OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE that can successfully discover domains among both TRAINING AND TEST DATA . we extensively evaluate our approach on OBJECT RECOGNITION and HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION TASKS .

the CODING EFFICIENCY of the new VIDEO CODING STANDARD , HIGH EFFICIENCY VIDEO CODING , is strongly associated with better use of SPATIO-TEMPORAL REDUNDANCIES thanks to an increased number of competing CODING MODES . however , this competition involves a massive increase in SIGNALING BITRATE which becomes a possible limit for the next generation of EN-CODER . this paper proposes a new CODING SCHEME that breaks with conventional approaches . CODING SCHEME exploits a more complex DECODER able to reproduce the choice of the ENCODER based on CAUSAL REFERENCES , eliminating thus the need to SIGNAL CODING MODES and associated parameters . the general outline of this new CODING SCHEME and a proposed implementation are described in this paper . experimental results under common test conditions report an AVERAGE BITRATE SAVING of 1.7 % at the same quality compared to HEVC for a wide range of VIDEO SEQUENCES .
