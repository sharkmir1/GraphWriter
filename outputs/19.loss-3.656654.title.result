this paper describes ongoing research on a JAPANESE-TO-ENGLISH SPEECH-TO-SPEECH TRANSLATION SYSTEM for '' controlled <unk> '' , such as TV NEWS and COMMENTARY PROGRAMS in which the SPEAKING STYLES are controlled as a <unk> . we have adopted the DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH since the tv programs in question cover a wide range of topics , and because it seems much too labor intensive to <unk> TRANSLATION RULES . the DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH therefore requires a <unk> PARALLEL CORPUS for the target domain , although the ABSOLUTE SIZE needed is not so easy to obtain . there are also difficulties inherent in <unk> such as the need to handle long sentences , averaging over 25 words , and the REALIZATION OF SIMULTANEITY . these problems are presented in the light of our available corpora and we go on to present the kinds of problems we have to solve . finally , we present our prospective system architecture and introduce the present status of the work .

efficient two-step algorithms are described for optimizing the STOPBAND RESPONSE of the PROTOTYPE FILTER for COSINE-MODULATED AND MODIFIED DFT FILTER BANKS either in the MINIMAX or in the least-mean-square sense subject to the maximum allowable ALIASING AND AMPLITUDE ERRORS . the first step involves finding a good START-UP SOLUTION using a simple technique . this START-UP SOLUTION is improved in the second step by using NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION . several examples are included illustrating the flexibility of the proposed START-UP SOLUTION for making compromises between the required FILTER LENGTHS and the ALIASING AND AMPLITUDE ERRORS . these examples show that by allowing very small amplitude and ALIASING ERRORS , the stopband performance of the resulting PROTOTYPE FILTER is significantly improved compared to the corresponding PERFECT-RECONSTRUCTION FILTER BANK . alternatively , the FILTER ORDERS and , consequently , the overall delay can be significantly reduced to achieve practically the same performance .

POINT-WISE RANKING FUNCTIONS assign a score to each object independently , without taking into account the other objects under consideration ; whereas LISTWISE LOSS FUNCTIONS evaluate the set of scores assigned to all objects as a whole . in many SUPERVISED LEARNING to RANK TASKS , it might be of interest to use LISTWISE RANKING FUNCTIONS instead ; in particular , the BAYES OPTIMAL RANKING FUNCTIONS might themselves be <unk> , especially if the LOSS FUNCTION is <unk> . a key <unk> to using LIST-WISE RANKING FUNCTIONS has been the lack of an appropriate REPRESENTATION THEORY for such functions . we show that a NATURAL SYMMETRICITY ASSUMPTION that we call exchangeability allows us to explicitly characterize the set of such EXCHANGEABLE LISTWISE RANKING FUNCTIONS . our analysis draws from the theories of TENSOR ANALYSIS , FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS and DE FINETTI THEOREMS . we also present experiments using a novel RERANKING METHOD motivated by our REPRESENTATION THEORY .

HIGHER LEVEL INFORMATION such as HISTORY , EXPECTATION , DISCOURSE KNOWLEDGE and PRAGMATICS can improve performance but are hard to quantify and effectively include in the RECOGNITION PROCESS . in this paper , DIALOGUE EXPECTATION is used to improve RECOGNITION . by permitting the DIALOGUE MANAGER to guide the interaction it is possible to track the DIALOGUE STATE and thus estimate the expected semantic content of the user 's response . the DIALOGUE MANAGER is allowed to process a large number of sentences provided by the DECODER .

mention pair MENTION PAIR MODELS that predict whether or not two mentions are coreferent have historically been very effective for COREF-ERENCE RESOLUTION , but do not make use of ENTITY-LEVEL INFORMATION . however , we show that the scores produced by such MENTION PAIR MODELS can be aggregated to define powerful ENTITY-LEVEL FEATURES between clusters of mentions . using these FEATURES , we train an ENTITY-CENTRIC COREFERENCE SYSTEM that learns an effective POLICY for building up COREFERENCE CHAINS incrementally . the MENTION PAIR SCORES are also used to prune the SEARCH SPACE the ENTITY-CENTRIC COREFERENCE SYSTEM works in , allowing for efficient training with an exact LOSS FUNCTION . we evaluate our ENTITY-CENTRIC COREFERENCE SYSTEM on the ENGLISH PORTION of the 2012 CONLL SHARED TASK DATASET and show that ENTITY-CENTRIC COREFERENCE SYSTEM improves over the current state of the art .

spectral EMBEDDING based on the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is a widely used '' preprocessing '' step in many LEARNING TASKS , typically leading to DI-MENSIONALITY REDUCTION by projecting onto a number of DOMINANT SINGULAR VECTORS and <unk> the COORDINATE AXES -lrb- by a PREDEFINED FUNCTION of the singular value -rrb- . however , the number of such vectors required to capture PROBLEM STRUCTURE grows with PROBLEM SIZE , and even PARTIAL SVD COMPUTATION becomes a bottleneck . in this paper , we propose a LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , which employs RANDOM PROJECTIONS and FINITE ORDER POLYNOMIAL EXPANSIONS to compute approximations to SVD-BASED EMBEDDING . for an M  N MATRIX with T NON-ZEROS , its TIME COMPLEXITY is o -lrb- -lrb- t + m + n -rrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , and the EMBEDDING DIMENSION is o -lrb- log -lrb- m + n -rrb- -rrb- , both of which are independent of the number of SINGULAR VECTORS whose effect we wish to capture . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to circumvent this dependence on the number of SINGULAR VECTORS for GENERAL SVD-BASED EMBEDDINGS . the key to <unk> the SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION is the observation that , for DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS such as CLUSTERING and classification , we are only interested in using the resulting EMBEDDING to evaluate PAIRWISE SIMILARITY METRICS derived from the  2-norm , rather than capturing the effect of the underlying MATRIX on ARBITRARY VECTORS as a partial SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION tries to do . our numerical results on NETWORK DATASETS demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed LOW-COMPLEXITY COMPRESSIVE SPECTRAL EMBEDDING ALGORITHM , and motivate further exploration of its application to DOWNSTREAM INFERENCE TASKS .

UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM exploits the ACOUSTIC SIMILARITY between multiple acoustic tokens of the same words or WORD-LIKE FRAGMENTS . in its current form , the UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM is able to discover words in speech with low <unk> -lrb- connected digits -rrb- . although its performance still falls off compared to MAINSTREAM ASR APPROACHES , the value of the UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM is its potential to serve as a COMPUTATIONAL MODEL in two research directions . first , the UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM may lead to an approach for SPEECH RECOGNITION that is fundamentally <unk> from the MODELLING CONSTRAINTS in conventional ASR . second , the proposed UNSUPERVISED ALGORITHM can be interpreted as a COMPUTATIONAL MODEL of LANGUAGE ACQUISITION that takes actual speech as input and is able to find words as 'em <unk> ' properties from RAW INPUT .

this paper describes some improvements in SPEECH RECOGNITION OF BROADCAST NEWS COMMENTARY in JAPANESE . since NEWS COMMENTARY SPEECH has different LINGUISTIC AND ACOUSTIC FEATURES from READ SPEECH , it gives lower WORD RECOGNITION ACCURACY . in this paper we apply to news <unk> some RULES which represent the LINGUISTIC FEATURES OF NEWS COMMENTARIES , and generate WORD SEQUENCES for LANGUAGE MODEL ADAPTATION . we also use a large volume of transcriptions of NEWS PROGRAMS as training texts . ACOUSTIC MODELS are <unk> and their structures are changed so as to recognize relatively short phonemes , because we found the SPEECH RATE of NEWS COMMENTARY is sometimes much faster than that of READ SPEECH . furthermore , by using a DECODER that can handle CROSSWORD TRIPHONE MODELS , we reduced the WORD ERROR RATE by 32 % .

the COMPACT DESCRIPTION OF A VIDEO SEQUENCE through a single IMAGE MAP and a DOMINANT MOTION has applications in several domains , including VIDEO BROWSING AND RETRIEVAL , COMPRESSION , MOSAICING , and VISUAL SUMMARIZATION . building such a COMPACT DESCRIPTION OF A VIDEO SEQUENCE requires the capability to register all the frames with respect to the dominant object in the scene , a task which has been , in the past , addressed through TEMPORALLY LOCALIZED MOTION ESTIMATES . in this paper , we show how the lack of TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY associated with such estimates can <unk> the validity of the DOMINANT MOTION ASSUMPTION , leading to <unk> between different scene interpretations and poor registration . to avoid this <unk> , we augment the MOTION MODEL with a GENERIC TEMPORAL CONSTRAINT which increases the ROBUSTNESS against competing interpretations , leading to more meaningful CONTENT SUMMARIZATION .

<unk> object BOUNDING BOX is a simple and popular INTERACTION PARADIGM considered by many existing INTERACTIVE IMAGE SEGMENTATION FRAMEWORKS . however , these frameworks tend to exploit the provided BOUNDING BOX merely to exclude its <unk> from consideration and sometimes to initialize the ENERGY MINIMIZATION . in this paper , we discuss how the BOUNDING BOX can be further used to impose a powerful TOPOLOGICAL PRIOR , which prevents the solution from EXCESSIVE SHRINKING and ensures that the USER-PROVIDED BOX bounds the segmentation in a sufficiently tight way . the TOPOLOGICAL PRIOR is expressed using HARD CONSTRAINTS incorporated into the GLOBAL ENERGY MINIMIZATION FRAMEWORK leading to an NP-HARD INTEGER PROGRAM . we then investigate the possible OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES including LINEAR RELAXATION as well as a new GRAPH CUT ALGORITHM called PINPOINTING . the latter can be used either as a ROUNDING METHOD for the FRACTIONAL LP SOLUTION , which is provably better than THRESHOLDING-BASED ROUNDING , or as a fast STANDALONE HEURISTIC . we evaluate the proposed algorithms on a PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATASET , and demonstrate the practical benefits of the new TOPOLOGICAL PRIOR both qualitatively and quantitatively .

the ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY MEASURE has recently been introduced in the context of FACE RECOGNITION where ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY MEASURE was used to produce state-of-the-art results . given two vectors , their ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY SCORE reflects the likelihood of each vector belonging in the same class as the other vector and not in a class defined by a fixed set of '' negative '' examples . the potential of this approach has thus far been largely <unk> . in this paper we analyze the ONE-SHOT SCORE and show that : -lrb- 1 -rrb- when using a version of LDA as the underlying CLASSIFIER , this score is a CONDITIONALLY POSITIVE DEFINITE KERNEL and may be used within <unk> -lrb- e.g. , svm -rrb- , -lrb- 2 -rrb- ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY MEASURE can be efficiently computed , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- that ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY MEASURE is effective as an underlying mechanism for IMAGE REPRESENTATION . we further demonstrate the effectiveness of the ONE-SHOT SIMILARITY SCORE in a number of applications including MULTI-CLASS IDENTIFICATION and DESCRIPTOR GENERATION .

multi-task learning attempts to simultaneously leverage data from multiple domains in order to estimate related functions on each domain . for example , a special case of MULTI-TASK LEARNING , TRANSFER LEARNING , is often employed when one has a good estimate of a function on a SOURCE DOMAIN , but is unable to estimate a related function well on a target domain using only target data . MULTI-TASK/TRANSFER LEARNING PROBLEMS are usually solved by imposing some kind of '' smooth '' relationship <unk> tasks . in this paper , we study how different SMOOTHNESS ASSUMPTIONS on TASK RELATIONS affect the upper bounds of algorithms proposed for these MULTI-TASK/TRANSFER LEARNING PROBLEMS under different settings . for general MULTI-TASK LEARNING , we study a family of algorithms which utilize a REWEIGHTING MATRIX on task weights to capture the smooth relationship among tasks , which has many instantiations in existing literature . furthermore , for MULTI-TASK LEARNING in a TRANSFER LEARNING FRAMEWORK , we study the recently proposed algorithms for the '' model shift '' , where the conditional distribution p -lrb- y | x -rrb- is allowed to change across tasks but the change is assumed to be smooth . in addition , we illustrate our results with experiments on both SIMULATED AND REAL DATA .

previous RESOLUTION-BASED APPROACHES to THEORY-GUIDED INDUCTION OF LOGIC PROGRAMS produce hypotheses in the form of a set of <unk> of a theory , where the RESOLVENTS represent allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS for the initial theory . there are , however , many characterizations of allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS that can not be expressed by a set of RESOLVENTS . one approach to this THEORY-GUIDED INDUCTION OF LOGIC PROGRAMS is presented , the system <unk> , which is based on an earlier technique for learning NITE-STATE AUTOMATA that represent allowed sequences of RESOLUTION STEPS . <unk> extends the previous technique in three ways : i -rrb- negative examples are considered in addition to positive examples , ii -rrb- a new strategy for performing GENERALIZATION is used , and iii -rrb- a technique for converting the learned automaton to a LOGIC PROGRAM is included . results from experiments are presented in which <unk> outperforms both a system using the old strategy for performing GENERALIZATION , and a traditional COVERING TECHNIQUE . the latter result can be explained by the limited expressiveness of hypotheses produced by covering and also by the fact that covering needs to produce the correct BASE CLAUSES for a RECURSIVE DENITION before producing the RECURSIVE CLAUSES . <unk> on the other hand does not require that particular examples of the base cases are given , since both BASE CLAUSES and RECURSIVE CLAUSES can be inferred from a single example .

online <unk> handwriting recognition is currently one of the most intriguing challenges in PATTERN RECOGNITION . this study presents a novel approach to this ONLINE CURSIVE HANDWRITING RECOGNITION which is composed of two complementary phases . the first is DYNAMIC ENCODING of the WRITING TRA-JECTORY into a compact sequence of DISCRETE MOTOR CONTROL SYMBOLS . in this COMPACT REPRESENTATION we largely remove the redundancy of the script , while preserving most of its INTELLIGIBLE COMPONENTS . in the second phase these CONTROL SEQUENCES are used to train ADAPTIVE PROBABILISTIC ACYCLIC AUTOMATA for the important ingredients of the WRITING TRAJECTORIES , e.g. letters . we present a new and efficient LEARNING ALGORITHM for such STOCHASTIC AUTOMATA , and demonstrate its utility for SPOTTING AND SEGMENTATION OF CURSIVE SCRIPTS . our experiments show that over 90 % of the letters are correctly spotted and identified , prior to any higher LEVEL LANGUAGE MODEL . moreover , both the TRAINING AND RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS are very efficient compared to other MODELING METHODS , and the TRAINING AND RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS are ` on-line ' adaptable to other writers and styles .

one of the most difficult tasks in VALUE FUNCTION APPROXIMATION for MARKOV DECISION PROCESSES is finding an APPROXIMATION ARCHITECTURE that is expressive enough to capture the important structure in the VALUE FUNCTION , while at the same time not overfitting the training samples . recent results in NON-PARAMETRIC APPROXIMATE LINEAR PROGRAMMING , have demonstrated that this can be done effectively using nothing more than a SMOOTHNESS ASSUMPTION on the VALUE FUNCTION . in this paper we extend these results to the case where samples come from REAL WORLD TRANSITIONS instead of the full BELLMAN EQUATION , adding ROBUSTNESS to NOISE . in addition , we provide the first <unk> , finite sample performance guarantees for any form of ALP . NON-PARAMETRIC APPROXIMATE LINEAR PROGRAMMING is amenable to problems with large -lrb- multidimensional -rrb- or even INFINITE ACTION SPACES , and does not require a model to select actions using the resulting APPROXIMATE SOLUTION .

UNVOICED SEGMENTS are then labeled by the complementary portions of SEGREGATED VOICED SPEECH . our UNSUPERVISED APPROACH does not require any PRETRAINED MODEL and is computationally simple . evaluations and comparisons show that the proposed UNSUPERVISED APPROACH outperforms a MODEL-BASED METHOD in terms of SPEECH SEGREGATION .

we introduce a new CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM based on the concept of SYMMETRIC MAXIMIZED MINIMAL DISTANCE in subspace -lrb- SMMS -rrb- . given the training data of authentic samples and IMPOSTER SAMPLES in the FEATURE SPACE , SMMS tries to identify a SUBSPACE in which all the authentic samples are close to each other and all the IMPOSTER SAMPLES are far away from the authentic samples . the OPTIMALITY of the SUBSPACE is determined by maximizing the minimal distance between the authentic samples and the IMPOSTER SAMPLES in the SUBSPACE . we present a procedure to achieve such OPTIMALITY and to identify the DECISION BOUNDARY . the verification procedure is simple since we only need to project the test sample to the SUBSPACE and compare it against the DECISION BOUNDARY . using FACE AUTHENTICATION as an example , we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several other algorithms based on SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES .

naive bayes -lrb- nb -rrb- is well-known to be a simple but effective CLASSIFIER , especially when combined with FEATURE SELECTION . unfortunately , FEATURE SELECTION METHODS are often greedy and thus can not guarantee an optimal feature set is selected . an alternative to FEATURE SELECTION is to use BAYESIAN MODEL averaging -lrb- BMA -rrb- , which computes a weighted average over multiple predictors ; when the different PREDICTOR MODELS correspond to different feature sets , BMA has the advantage over FEATURE SELECTION that its predictions tend to have lower variance on average in comparison to any single model . in this paper , we show for the first time that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER is possible to exactly evaluate BMA over the <unk> <unk> of NB FEATURE MODELS in linear-time in the number of FEATURES ; this yields an algorithm about as expensive to train as a single NB MODEL with all FEATURES , but yet provably converges to the GLOBALLY OPTIMAL FEATURE SUBSET in the ASYMPTOTIC LIMIT OF DATA . we evaluate this novel BMA-NB CLASSIFIER on a range of datasets showing that BMA-NB CLASSIFIER never <unk> nb -lrb- as expected -rrb- and sometimes offers performance competitive -lrb- or superior -rrb- to CLASSIFIERS such as SVMS and logistic regression while taking a fraction of the time to train .

in this paper , we propose a novel domain-independent binary classifier for asr hypothesis . the domain-independent binary classifier is based on the normalized mutual information and normalized mutual information in a test domain . we show that this domain-independent binary classifier can be used to generate across-domain clusters , which are then used to train a domain-independent binary classifier for the test domain . finally , we show that cluster-specific classifiers can be used to generate across-domain clusters and cluster-specific classifiers .

a common approach in VISUAL SPEECH SYNTHESIS is the use of VISEMES as ATOMIC UNITS OF SPEECH . in this paper , PHONEME-BASED AND VISEME-BASED AUDIOVISUAL SPEECH SYNTHESIS TECHNIQUES are compared in order to explore the balancing between data availability and an improved AUDIOVISUAL COHERENCE for SYNTHESIS OPTIMIZATION . a technique for AUTOMATIC VISEME CLUSTERING is described and it is compared to the STANDARDIZED VISEME SET described in MPEG-4 . both objective and subjective testing indicated that a <unk> approach leads to better synthesis results . in addition , the test results improve when more different VISEMES are defined . this raises some questions on the widely applied <unk> approach . it appears that a MANY-TO-ONE PHONEME-TO-VISEME MAPPING is not capable of describing all subtle details of the VISUAL SPEECH INFORMATION . in addition , with VISEME-BASED SYNTHESIS the PERCEIVED SYNTHESIS QUALITY is affected by the loss of AUDIOVISUAL COHERENCE in the SYNTHETIC SPEECH .

LOCALIZED MATCHING CRITERIA , e.g. , PIXEL-BASED SSD , may enable the RECOVERY OF ALL MOTION PARAMETERS , but it does not tolerate much APPEARANCE CHANGES . on the other hand , GLOBAL CRITERIA , e.g. , MATCHING HISTOGRAMS , can accommodate DRAMATIC APPEARANCE CHANGES , but may be blind to some MOTION PARAMETERS , e.g. , SCALING and ROTATION . this paper presents a novel CLOSED FORM SOLUTION that integrates the advantages of both in a principled way based on a SPATIAL-APPEARANCE MODEL that combines LOCAL APPEARANCES VARIATIONS and GLOBAL SPATIAL STRUCTURES . this CLOSED FORM SOLUTION can capture a large variety of APPEARANCE VARIATIONS that are attributed to the LOCAL NON-RIGIDITY . at the same time , this CLOSED FORM SOLUTION enables efficient RECOVERY OF ALL MOTION PARAMETERS . a MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD MATCHING CRITERION is defined and rigorous analytical results are obtained that lead to a CLOSED FORM SOLUTION to MOTION TRACKING . very encouraging results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CLOSED FORM SOLUTION for TRACKING NON-RIGID OBJECTS that exhibit DRAMATIC APPEARANCE DEFORMATIONS , LARGE OBJECT SCALE CHANGES and PARTIAL OCCLUSIONS .

in MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS with tens of thousands of FEATURES and only dozens or hundreds of independent training examples , DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION is essential for good learning performance . in previous work , many researchers have treated the MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEMS in two separate phases : first use an algorithm such as SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION to reduce the dimensionality of the data set , and then use a CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM such as na <unk> ve bayes or support vector machines to learn a CLASSIFIER . we demonstrate that it is possible to combine the two goals of DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION and classification into a single learning objective , and present a novel and efficient algorithm which optimizes this objective directly . we present experimental results in FMRI ANALYSIS which show that we can achieve better learning performance and LOWER-DIMENSIONAL REPRESENTATIONS than TWO-PHASE APPROACHES can .

the success of an IMAGE CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM largely depends on how it incorporates LOCAL INFORMATION in the GLOBAL DECISION . popular approaches such as AVERAGE-POOLING and MAX-POOLING are suboptimal in many situations . in this paper we propose region ranking svm -lrb- <unk> -rrb- , a novel method for POOLING LOCAL INFORMATION from multiple regions . <unk> exploits the correlation of LOCAL REGIONS in an IMAGE , and it jointly learns a REGION EVALUATION FUNCTION and a scheme for integrating multiple regions . experiments on pascal voc 2007 , voc 2012 , and ILSVRC2014 DATASETS show that <unk> outperforms the methods that use the same FEATURE TYPE and extract features from the same set of LOCAL REGIONS . <unk> achieves similar to or better than the state-of-the-art performance on all datasets .

causal structure learning from TIME SERIES DATA is a major scientific challenge . EXTANT ALGORITHMS assume that measurements occur sufficiently quickly ; more precisely , they assume approximately equal system and measurement timescales . in many domains , however , measurements occur at a significantly slower rate than the underlying system changes , but the size of the TIMESCALE MISMATCH is often unknown . this paper develops three CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS , each of which discovers all DYNAMIC CAUSAL GRAPHS that explain the OBSERVED MEASUREMENT DATA , perhaps given UNDERSAMPLING . that is , these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS all learn CAUSAL STRUCTURE in a `` <unk> '' manner : they do not assume any particular relation between the measurement and system timescales . we apply these CAUSAL STRUCTURE LEARNING ALGORITHMS to data from simulations to gain insight into the challenge of UNDERSAMPLING .

in GAME-PLAYING PROGRAMS relying on the MINIMAX PRINCIPLE , DEEPER SEARCHES generally produce better evaluations . theoretical analyses , however , suggest that in many cases <unk> amplifies the NOISE introduced by the HEURISTIC FUNCTION used to evaluate the leaves of the GAME TREE , leading to what is known as PATHOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR , where DEEPER SEARCHES produce worse evaluations . in most of the previous research , positions were evaluated as losses or wins . dependence between the values of positions close to each other was identified as the property of realistic GAME TREES that eliminates the PATHOLOGY and explains why MINIMAX is successful in practice . in this paper we present an alternative explanation that does not rely on VALUE DEPENDENCE . we show that if real numbers are used for POSITION VALUES , POSITION VALUES tend to be further apart at lower levels of the GAME TREE , which leads to a larger proportion of more extreme positions , where error is less probable . decreased probability of error in searches to greater depths is sufficient to eliminate the PATHOLOGY and no additional properties of GAME TREES are required .

the majority of the existing algorithms for LEARNING DECISION TREES are greedy -- a TREE is induced top-down , making locally optimal decisions at each node . in most cases , however , the CONSTRUCTED TREE is not globally optimal . furthermore , the GREEDY ALGORITHMS require a fixed amount of time and are not able to generate a better TREE if additional time is available . to overcome this problem , we present two LOOKAHEAD-BASED ALGORITHMS for ANYTIME INDUCTION OF DECISION TREES , thus allowing tradeoff between TREE QUALITY and LEARNING TIME . the first one is DEPTH-K LOOKAHEAD , where a larger TIME ALLOCATION permits larger k . the second algorithm uses a novel strategy for evaluating candidate splits ; a STOCHASTIC VERSION of ID3 is repeatedly invoked to estimate the size of the TREE in which each split results , and the one that minimizes the expected size is preferred . experimental results indicate that for several hard concepts , our proposed approach exhibits good anytime behavior and yields significantly better DECISION TREES when more time is available .

<unk> analysis <unk> in applications of BINARY CLASSIFICATION where true negatives do not add value and hence should not affect assessment of the CLASSIFIER 's performance . perhaps inspired by the many advantages of RECEIVER OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC CURVES and the area under such curves for ACCURACY-BASED PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT , many researchers have taken to report PRECISION-RECALL CURVES and associated areas as PERFORMANCE METRIC . we demonstrate in this paper that this practice is <unk> with difficulties , mainly because of INCOHERENT SCALE ASSUMPTIONS -- e.g. , the area under a PR CURVE takes the ARITHMETIC MEAN OF PRECISION VALUES whereas the F  SCORE applies the harmonic mean . we show how to fix this by plotting PR CURVES in a different COORDINATE SYSTEM , and demonstrate that the new PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES inherit all key advantages of ROC CURVES . in particular , the area under PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES conveys an expected f 1 score on a HARMONIC SCALE , and the CONVEX HULL of a PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVE allows us to calibrate the CLASSIFIER 's scores so as to determine , for each operating point on the CONVEX HULL , the INTERVAL OF  VALUES for which the point optimises F  . we demonstrate experimentally that the area under traditional PR CURVES can easily favour models with lower expected f 1 score than others , and so the use of PRECISION-RECALL-GAIN CURVES will result in better MODEL SELECTION .

enlarging or reducing the TEMPLATE SIZE by adding new parts , or removing parts of the template , according to their suitability for TRACKING , requires the ability to deal with the variation of the TEMPLATE SIZE . for instance , REAL-TIME TEMPLATE TRACKING using LINEAR PREDICTORS , although fast and reliable , requires using templates of fixed size and does not allow ON-LINE MODIFICATION of the predictor . to solve this problem we propose the ADAPTIVE LINEAR PREDICTORS which enable fast online modifications of PRE-LEARNED LINEAR PREDICTORS . instead of applying a FULL MATRIX INVERSION for every modification of the TEMPLATE SHAPE as standard approaches to learning LINEAR PREDICTORS do , we just perform a fast update of this inverse . this allows us to learn the ADAPTIVE LINEAR PREDICTORS in a much shorter time than standard LEARNING APPROACHES while performing equally well . we performed exhaustive evaluation of our ADAPTIVE LINEAR PREDICTORS and compared ADAPTIVE LINEAR PREDICTORS to standard LINEAR PREDICTORS and other state of the art approaches .

recognizing materials in REAL-WORLD IMAGES is a challenging task . REAL-WORLD MATERIALS have RICH SURFACE TEXTURE , GEOMETRY , LIGHTING CONDITIONS , and CLUTTER , which combine to make the problem particularly difficult . in this paper , we introduce a new , LARGE-SCALE , OPEN DATASET OF MATERIALS in the wild , the MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE , and combine this dataset with DEEP LEARNING to achieve MATERIAL RECOGNITION and segmentation of images in the wild . MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE is an order of magnitude larger than previous MATERIAL DATABASES , while being more diverse and <unk> across its 23 categories . using MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE , we train CONVOLU-TIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS -lrb- cnns -rrb- for two tasks : CLASSIFYING MATERIALS from PATCHES , and SIMULTANEOUS MATERIAL RECOGNITION and segmentation in FULL IMAGES . for PATCH-BASED CLASSIFICATION on MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE we found that the best performing MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE can achieve <unk> % MEAN CLASS ACCURACY . we convert these trained CNN CLASSIFIERS into an efficient fully convolutional framework combined with a fully connected conditional random field -lrb- crf -rrb- to predict the material at every PIXEL in an image , achieving <unk> % MEAN CLASS ACCURACY . our experiments demonstrate that having a large , WELL-SAMPLED DATASET such as MATERIALS IN CONTEXT DATABASE is crucial for REAL-WORLD MATERIAL RECOGNITION and segmentation .

3d object reconstruction from a single 2D LINE DRAWING is an important problem in both COMPUTER VISION and graphics . many methods have been put forward to solve this problem , but they usually fail when the GEOMETRIC STRUCTURE of a 3D OBJECT becomes complex . in this paper , a novel approach based on a DIVIDE-AND-CONQUER STRATEGY is proposed to handle 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF COMPLEX MANIFOLD OBJECTS from SINGLE 2D LINE DRAWINGS . the approach consists of three steps : 1 -rrb- dividing a complex LINE DRAWING into multiple simpler line drawings based on the result of FACE IDENTIFICATION ; 2 -rrb- reconstructing the 3D SHAPES from these simpler line drawings ; and 3 -rrb- merging the 3D SHAPES into one complete object represented by the original LINE DRAWING . a number of examples are given to show that our approach can handle 3D RECONSTRUCTION OF MORE COMPLEX OBJECTS than previous methods .

motion information is essential in many COMPUTER VISION and VIDEO ANALYSIS TASKS . since MPEG is still one of the most prevalent formats for representing , transferring and storing video data , the analysis of its motion field is important for real time video indexing and segmentation , EVENT ANALYSIS and SURVEILLANCE APPLICATIONS . our work considers the problem of improving the OPTICAL FLOW FIELD in MPEG SEQUENCES . we address the issues of robust , incremental , dense optical flow estimation by combining information from two different VELOCITY FIELDS : the available MPEG MOTION FIELD and the one inferred by a MULTIRESOLUTION ROBUST REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUE applied on the DC COEFFICIENTS . thus , the MULTIRESOLUTION ROBUST REGULARIZATION TECHNIQUE is based only on information that is directly available in the COMPRESSED STREAM avoiding therefore the time and MEMORY CONSUMING DECOMPRESSION . we extend standard techniques by adding a TEMPORAL CONTINUITY and an MPEG CONSISTENCY CONSTRAINT , both as MATHEMATICAL CONSTRAINTS in the OBJECTIVE FUNCTION and as hypothesis tests for the presence of MOTION DISCONTINUITIES . our approach is shown to perform well over a range of different MOTION SCENARIOS and can serve as a basis for efficient VIDEO ANALYSIS TASKS .

forced alignment for SPEECH SYNTHESIS traditionally aligns a PHONEME SEQUENCE predetermined by the FRONT-END TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEM . this sequence is not altered during alignment , i.e. , it is forced , despite possibly being faulty . the CONSISTENCY ASSUMPTION is the assumption that these mistakes do not degrade models , as long as the mistakes are consistent across training and synthesis . we present evidence that in the alignment of both standard READ PROMPTS and SPONTANEOUS SPEECH this PHONEME SEQUENCE is often wrong , and that this is likely to have a negative impact on ACOUSTIC MODELS . a LATTICE-BASED FORCED ALIGNMENT SYSTEM allowing for PRONUNCIATION VARIATION is implemented , resulting in improved PHONEME IDENTITY ACCURACY for both types of speech . a perceptual evaluation of HMM-BASED VOICES showed that SPONTANEOUS MODELS trained on this improved alignment also improved standard synthesis , despite breaking the CONSISTENCY ASSUMPTION .

bounded confidence opinion dynamic models have received much recent interest as models of INFORMATION PROPAGATION in SOCIAL NETWORKS and LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTED AVERAGING . however in the existing literature , opinions are only viewed as abstract quantities rather than as part of a DECISION-MAKING SYSTEM . in this work , OPINION DYNAMICS are examined when agents are BAYESIAN DECISION MAKERS that perform HYPOTHESIS TESTING or SIGNAL DETECTION . BOUNDED CONFIDENCE is defined on PRIOR PROBABILITIES of hypotheses through BAYES RISK ERROR DIVERGENCE , the appropriate measure between PRIORS in HYPOTHESIS TESTING . this definition contrasts with the measure used between opinions in the standard model : absolute error . it is shown that the rapid convergence of PRIOR PROBABILITIES to a small number of LIMITING VALUES is similar to that seen in the standard model . the most interesting finding in this work is that the number of these LIMITING VALUES changes with the SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO in the HYPOTHESIS TESTING TASK . the number of final values or CLUSTERS is maximal at INTERMEDIATE SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIOS , suggesting that the most <unk> issues lead to the largest number of <unk> .

traditional techniques of DENSE OPTICAL FLOW ESTIMATION do n't generally yield SYMMETRICAL SOLUTIONS : the results will differ if SYMMETRICAL SOLUTIONS are applied between IMAGES I1 and I2 or between IMAGES I2 and I1 . in this work , we present a method to recover a DENSE OPTICAL FLOW FIELD MAP from two IMAGES , while <unk> taking into account the symmetry across the IMAGES as well as possible occlusions and discontinuities in the FLOW FIELD . the idea is to consider both DISPLACEMENTS VECTORS from I1 to I2 and I2 to I1 and to minimise an ENERGY FUNCTIONAL that <unk> encodes all those properties . this VARIATIONAL PROBLEM is then solved using the GRADIENT FLOW defined by the EULER -- LAGRANGE EQUATIONS associated to the energy . in order to reduce the risk to be trapped within some irrelevant minimum , a FOCUSING STRATEGY based on a MULTI-RESOLUTION TECHNIQUE is used to converge toward the solution . promising experimental results on both SYNTHETIC AND REAL IMAGES are presented to illustrate the capabilities of this symmetrical variational approach to recover accurate OPTICAL FLOW .

we present a novel approach to RELATIVE POSE ESTIMATION which is tailored to 4D LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS . from the relationships between SCENE GEOMETRY and LIGHT FIELD STRUCTURE and an analysis of the LIGHT FIELD PROJECTION in terms of PLCKER RAY COORDINATES , we deduce a set of LINEAR CONSTRAINTS on RAY SPACE CORRESPONDENCES between a pair of LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS . these can be applied to infer RELATIVE POSE OF THE LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS and thus obtain a POINT CLOUD RECONSTRUCTION OF THE SCENE . while the proposed method has interesting relationships to pose estimation for GENERALIZED CAMERAS based on RAY-TO-RAY CORRESPONDENCE , our experiments demonstrate that our approach is both more accurate and computationally more efficient . it also compares favorably to DIRECT LINEAR POSE ESTIMATION based on aligning the 3D POINT CLOUDS obtained by reconstructing depth for each individual light field . to further validate the method , we employ the POSE ESTIMATES to merge LIGHT FIELDS captured with HAND-HELD CONSUMER LIGHT FIELD CAMERAS into REFOCUS-ABLE PANORAMAS .

unsupervised feature learning algorithms based on CON-VOLUTIONAL FORMULATIONS of INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS ANALYSIS have been demonstrated to yield state-of-the-art results in several ACTION RECOGNITION BENCHMARKS . however , existing approaches do not allow for the number of LATENT COMPONENTS -lrb- features -rrb- to be automatically inferred from the data in an UNSUPERVISED MANNER . this is a significant disadvantage of the state-of-the-art , as it results in considerable burden imposed on researchers and practitioners , who must resort to TEDIOUS CROSS-VALIDATION PROCEDURES to obtain the optimal number of LATENT FEATURES . to resolve these issues , in this paper we introduce a convolutional <unk> bayesian sparse ica architecture for OVERCOMPLETE FEATURE LEARNING from HIGH-DIMENSIONAL DATA . our method utilizes an INDIAN BUFFET PROCESS prior to facilitate INFERENCE of the appropriate number of LATENT FEATURES under a HYBRID VARIATIONAL INFERENCE ALGORITHM , scalable to massive datasets . as we show , our model can be naturally used to obtain DEEP UNSUPERVISED HIERARCHICAL FEATURE EXTRACTORS , by greedily stacking SUCCESSIVE MODEL LAYERS , similar to existing approaches . in addition , INFERENCE for this model is completely <unk> ; thus , it obviates the need of TEDIOUS PARAMETER TUNING , which is a major challenge most deep learning approaches are faced with . we evaluate our method on several ACTION RECOGNITION BENCHMARKS , and exhibit its advantages over the state-of-the-art .

in this paper , we study the use of different FREQUENCY WARP-FACTORS for different ACOUSTIC CLASSES in a computationally efficient framework of VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION . this is motivated by the fact that all ACOUSTIC CLASSES do not exhibit similar spectral variations as a result of PHYSIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN VOCAL TRACT , and therefore , the use of a single FREQUENCY-WARP for the entire utterance may not be appropriate . we have recently proposed a VTLN METHOD that implements VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION through a LINEAR-TRANSFORMATION of the conventional MFCC FEATURES and efficiently estimates the WARP-FACTOR using the same sufficient statistics as that are used in CMLLR ADAPTATION . in this paper we have shown that , in this framework of VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION , and using the idea of REGRESSION CLASS TREE , we can obtain separate VOCAL TRACT LENGTH NORMALIZATION for different ACOUSTIC CLASSES . the use of REGRESSION CLASS TREE ensures that WARP-FACTOR is estimated for each class even when there is very little data available for that class . the ACOUSTIC CLASSES , in general , can be any collection of the GAUSSIAN COMPONENTS in the ACOUSTIC MODEL . we have built ACOUSTIC CLASSES by using DATA-DRIVEN APPROACH and by using PHONETIC KNOWLEDGE . using WSJ DATABASE we have shown the RECOGNITION performance of the proposed ACOUSTIC CLASS SPECIFIC WARP-FACTOR both for the data driven and the PHONETIC KNOWLEDGE BASED REGRESSION CLASS TREE DEFINITIONS and compare VTLN METHOD with the case of the single WARP-FACTOR .

standard ADAPTIVE FEEDBACK CANCELLATION ALGORITHMS in HEARING AIDS suffer from a BIASED ADAPTATION if the input signal is spectrally colored , as it is for TONAL SIGNALS , like music . due to that , DISTORTION ARTIFACTS are generated . in this paper , a SUB-BAND FEEDBACK CANCELLATION SYSTEM is presented combined with an ADAPTATION CONTROL to deal with those signals . two CONTROL CONCEPTS for determining the VARIABLE STEP SIZES -lsb- 1 , 2 -rsb- , known from GENERAL ADAPTIVE FILTER ALGORITHMS , are theoretically and practically analyzed and evaluated for an application to FEEDBACK CANCELLATION . for FEEDBACK CANCELLATION the control is combined with known methods to reduce the BIAS , such as PREDICTION ERROR FILTERING or FREQUENCY SHIFTING . based on this combination , a completely new SETUP for FEEDBACK CANCELLATION is proposed . SETUP relies entirely on signals accessible in real systems , shows a low COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY , and therefore has a strong practical relevance .

the CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS of the LEAST MEAN SQUARE ALGORITHM has been conventionally based on STOCHASTIC SIGNALS and describes thus only the average behavior of the LEAST MEAN SQUARE ALGORITHM . it has been shown previously that a PERIODIC-REFERENCE LMS SYSTEM can be regarded as a LINEAR TIME-PERIODIC SYSTEM whose stability can be determined from the MONODROMY MATRIX . generally , the MONODROMY MATRIX can only be solved numerically and does not thus reveal the actual factors behind the dynamics of the PERIODIC-REFERENCE LMS SYSTEM . this paper derives an ESTIMATOR for the eigenvalues of the MONODROMY MATRIX . the ESTIMATOR is easy to calculate , and ESTIMATOR also reveals the underlying reason for the bad convergence of the LEAST MEAN SQUARE ALGORITHM in some special cases . the ESTIMATOR is confirmed by comparing ESTIMATOR to the precise eigenvalues of the MONODROMY MATRIX . the ESTIMATOR is found to be accurate for the eigenvalues close to unity .

a central challenge in SEMANTIC PARSING is handling the myriad ways in which KNOWLEDGE BASE PREDICATES can be expressed . traditionally , SEMANTIC PARSERS are trained primarily from text paired with KNOWLEDGE BASE INFORMATION . our goal is to exploit the much larger amounts of RAW TEXT not tied to any KNOWLEDGE BASE . in this paper , we turn SEMANTIC PARSING on its head . given an input utterance , we first use a simple method to deterministically generate a set of CANDIDATE LOGICAL FORMS with a CANONICAL REALIZATION in NATURAL LANGUAGE for each . then , we use a PARAPHRASE MODEL to choose the realization that best paraphrases the input , and output the corresponding LOGICAL FORM . we present two simple PARAPHRASE MODEL , an ASSOCIATION MODEL and a VECTOR SPACE MODEL , and train PARAPHRASE MODEL jointly from QUESTION-ANSWER PAIRS . our system <unk> improves state-of-the-art ACCURACIES on two recently released QUESTION-ANSWERING DATASETS .

in some SPEAKER RECOGNITION SCENARIOS we find conversations recorded simultaneously over multiple channels . that is the case of the interviews in the NIST SRE DATASET . to take advantage of that , we propose a modification of the PLDA MODEL that considers two different INTER-SESSION VARIABILITY TERMS . the first term is tied between all the recordings belonging to the same conversation whereas the second is not . thus , the former mainly intends to capture the variability due to the PHONETIC CONTENT of the conversation while the latter tries to capture the CHANNEL VARIABILITY . we test this PLDA MODEL on the NIST SRE12 CORE CONDITION using multiple channels per interview to <unk> the speakers . the proposed PLDA MODEL improves the MINIMUM DCF by 26 -- 29 % on TELEPHONE SPEECH and by 1 -- 8 % on interviews compared to the standard PLDA -lrb- scored by the book -rrb- .

traditional MICROPHONE ARRAY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS simply recognise the enhanced output of the array . as the level of SIGNAL ENHANCEMENT depends on the number of microphones , such MICROPHONE ARRAY SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEMS do not achieve acceptable SPEECH RECOGNITION performance for arrays having only a few microphones . for SMALL MICROPHONE ARRAYS , we instead propose using the enhanced output to estimate a RELIABILITY MASK , which is then used in MISSING DATA SPEECH RECOGNITION . in MISSING DATA SPEECH RECOGNITION , the DECODED SEQUENCE depends on the RELIABILITY MASK of each input feature . this RELIABILITY MASK is usually based on the signal to noise ratio in each frequency band . in this paper , we use the energy difference between the NOISY INPUT and the enhanced output of a small microphone array to determine the FREQUENCY BAND RELIABILITY .

nuisance attribute projection -lrb- <unk> -rrb- and WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION are two effective techniques for INTERSESSION VARIABILITY COMPENSATION in SVM BASED SPEAKER VERIFICATION SYSTEMS . however , by normalizing or removing the NUISANCE SUBSPACE containing the SESSION VARIABILITY can not guarantee to enlarge the distance between speakers . in this paper , we investigated the probability of using LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS for DISCRIMINATIVE TRAINING . to cope with the small sample size problem which prevents us from using LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS directly , we adapted the WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION , which first projects the whole FEATURE SPACE into a relatively low dimensional SUBSPACE by LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS , and then performs LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS in the SUBSPACE . by some modification , the WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION can be <unk> into a kind of WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION , which we called WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION . experiments on NIST SRE TASKS showed that , the WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION outperformed the conventional WITHIN-CLASS COVARIANCE NORMALIZATION , especially in LOW DIMENSIONAL FEATURE SPACE .
